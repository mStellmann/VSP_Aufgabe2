%%  This function the the receive loop.
%%
%%  Params: [valid for all sources]
%%    OwnLevel:       The level of the fragment of the node which calls this function
%%    OwnEdgeOrddict: The orddict which contains the edge adjacent to this node
%%    OwnFragName:    The name of the fragment containing this node
%%    OwnNodeState:   The state of this node (sleeping,find,found)
%%    Otherlevel:     The level of the fragment of the node this node tries to connect to
%%    Edge:           The edge this node tries to connect trough
%%    FindCount:      TODO
